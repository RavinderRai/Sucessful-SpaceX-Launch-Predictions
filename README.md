# SpaceX-Launch-Predictions

A rocket launch is a costly endeavour, however it turns out that if on first attempt a rocket lands safely then the cost is significantly reduced. 
In this project the goal is to predict whether or not a rocket launch will have a successful landing on first attempt which will then indicate a cost reduction. 
This project makes use of python3, including packages like pandas and sklearn, as well as SQL.

## Necessary Python Libraries/Packages
Pandas - The standard python library to handle large datasets. A lot of the data comes in the form of a JSON file so pandas can easily handle this.

Matplotlib - This is a plotting library, and is standard for python. It is normally already installed when python is downloaded.

Numpy - This is the library that handles arrays. It is normally already installed when python is downloaded.

Sklearn - A library that enable our predictive modeling. We make use of sklearn mostly in the file: SpaceX_Machine Learning Prediction_Part_5.ipynb, which is where 
we use classification models like decision trees and SVM's to get our final predections.

Dash - A web app was created to make an interactive dashboard to view specific launch success rates. This was done via dash and plotly.

SQL - SQL and SQLite are used to perform some basic querying for data exploration.

### Installation
To install any library, just use the pip install function, for example: $ pip install Pillow

This will work for windows, mac and linux. For othe libraries, replace 'Pillow' with the name of the other library to be download.
